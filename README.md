## Description
This README.md generator was made to shorten the time we spend on our README files. The project asks questions and intakes the users answers. The questions and answers are used to be inserted to generate a new readme.md file. I used node.js to create this project. The challenges I faced was digesting new knowledge from node.js to create the project, however it was a huge and helpful step in learning and understanding node.js.

## Installation
- git clone 
- open file 

## Usage
- Open integrated terminal in file 
- Type 'node index.js' and answer the questions that come up in your terminal.
- Click on newREADME.md.
